# Intro to Deep Learning

Example scripts for running deep neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow2 in Python.

To run these you'll need python and the following pip packages installed. As Keras updates a lot (often breaking older code syntax) note the package version numbers the code was tested on. I recommend installing packages using a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/):
  * numpy 
  * scikit-learn
  * h5py
  * Pillow
  * matplotlib
  * tensorflow (ver. 1)
  * keras
  
*Note For Mac Users: I recommend installing `tensorflow` via Anaconda rather than PIP (also applies to R users). You might also need to also install the `nomkl` package to prevent a multithreading bug in `numpy`.*
